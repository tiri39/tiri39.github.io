I’m a Junior SQA Engineer at DSi, currently working with [OpenCRVS](https://www.opencrvs.org/).  
Most of my days go into testing new features, running regressions, and playing around with automation testing. 
I genuinely enjoy breaking things (in a good way) before they reach users.

I studied CSE and spent a lot of time doing competitive programming — just for fun.
